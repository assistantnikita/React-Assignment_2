DAY2 JavaScript:

ques 1) What are the differences between var, let and const?
var :- Old Way of declaring variables
          Can be reassigned and updated
example-      var x=10;
                console.log(x);//10
               x=15;
             console.log(x);//15

let : - Modern way of declaring variables.
         Can be reassigned but not redeclared.
 example-
       let a=10;
     console.log(a);//10

const :- values are not be changed and used for constant 
             cannot be reassigned or redeclared .
example-
  const a=40;
console.log(a);//40

ques 2) Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
 
*)undefined:- 
  Variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
 example 
  let x;
console.log(x);
// undefined

*)Not defined
Truying to access a variable that has not been declared.
example
conole.log(x);//x is not defined

*)NaN(not a number)
Invalid or undefiend mathematical operation
It is a special value of the number data type.
example
let a="a"/2;
console.log(a);



ques 3) What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
ans )  
*) undefined: - When a variable is declared but not assigned a value is called undefined.
                      -  if you access object property that doesnot exist , it return 'undefined'.	
                      Example -
                                       let x;
                                 console.log(x); //undefined
                         
                        let obj={"name":"nikita",  rollno=23}//undefined
                             

*) null: - It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty or does not point to any object.
             :- It if you access the prompt function and doesnot applies any input then it also returns null.
   example:-
   let z;
 console.log(z);//null

 let y=prompt("enter the number");
     console.log(y); //null



Ques 4) What is execution context?
ans ..The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.   
Execution context: 1) creation phase 2) Execution Phase

Creation Phase
-Memory space allocation
-Function declarations assiged
-Variable declarations assigned

Execution Phase
-js is executed line by line.


ques 5)  What is use of prompt in javascript?
ans .. Prompt is a methos that is used for taking input from the user.
       .. Prompt gets the input and show options ok or cancel, ok means it stores the data or information to the particular variable or cancel store null. 
example:- 
let a=prompt("enter the number "):
console.log(a);

Ques 6) Why js is dynamic language?
ans.. Dynamic language is a high-level programming language that at runtime excutes many common programming behaviours that static programming languages perform during compliation and these behaviour could be adding a new code, modifying.
